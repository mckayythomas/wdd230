# scoots
Scoots is a fictional scooter rental company based in Mexico. 
This site is not a real buisness but is a demonstration of current web development skills from the creator in connecting to a third party API,
making requests and desplaying results, and website desing and organizational skills.

This website was also used as a final project in my CSE 212 class.
